This code loads the noisy data from the specified file path, selects only the 'sepalLength' and 'sepalWidth' columns, and then calculates their means. The output will be a pandas Series with the mean values for each column.

Since I don't have direct access to the execution environment, I will simulate the correction by adding necessary imports and corrections in the code.
